# TypeScript for Playwright

This repository is a day-by-day TypeScript practice project.

## What this project is about

- Learning core TypeScript syntax and concepts through small examples.
- Building a strong TypeScript foundation for Playwright automation work.
- Keeping notes and practice files organized by day.

## Project structure

- `Day1` to `Day8`: topic-based TypeScript practice files.
- `.vscode/launch.json`: local debug configuration.

## Topics covered (so far)

- Variables and data types
- Operators
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)
- Named and anonymous functions
- Arrow functions (`Day7/ArrowFunction.ts`)
- Callback functions (`Day8/CallBackFunctions.ts`)

  - `getInfo(...)`: overloaded by `number` and `string` inputs
  - `convertValue(...)`: overloaded with 2 return types
    - `string -> number`
    - `number -> string`

## Goal

Use this repository as a personal TypeScript reference while learning Playwright test automation.
